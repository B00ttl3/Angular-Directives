<h2 *ngIf="isLoggedIn" >{{ userName }}</h2>

<h4 *ngIf="!isLoggedIn" >User is not loggen in</h4>



<!-- the new syntax approach is @If then we will add the component inside the () and then will get what we want inside the {}. In this we are just working with the new angular approach which starts with @ -->
